Description:
    Generate vue mixin

Example:
    rails g espresso:vue:mixin attachable

    This will create:
        app/javascript/src/application/js/components/mixin/attachable_mixin.js

    rails g espresso:vue:mixin atricle::replyable

    This will create:
        app/javascript/src/application/js/components/mixin/article/replyable_mixin.js

    By default, the scope will be `application`, if you want to generate
    initializer in different scope, using 2nd argument to make option.

    e.g.
    rails g espresso:vue:mixin attachable admin

    This will create:
        app/javascript/src/admin/js/components/mixin/attachable_mixin.js
